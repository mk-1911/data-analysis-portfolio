ðŸš— Cars Dataset Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of cars to uncover insights about fuel efficiency, engine performance, and overall trends.
The goal is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, Python visualization, and Power BI dashboarding.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis (Excel / Power Query).

- Use SQL to explore the data and answer analytical questions.

- Create Python visualizations to highlight key insights.

- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for storytelling.

ðŸ“Š Key Questions Answered

- What are the top 10 car manufacturers by average MPG?

- How does horsepower relate to fuel efficiency (HP vs MPG)?

- What is the relationship between number of cylinders and MPG?

- How do different fuel types perform in terms of efficiency?

- What are the top 10 cars with the best horsepower-to-MPG ratio?

- How does engine size and horsepower impact efficiency?

- How has average MPG changed over time (model years)?

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Excel / Power Query â†’ Data cleaning and preprocessing

- SQL (MySQL / SQLite) â†’ Data exploration and transformations

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â†’ Custom visualizations

- Power BI â†’ Interactive dashboard & storytelling

ðŸ“Œ Insights & Findings

Manufacturers like Honda, Toyota, and Mazda consistently deliver higher fuel efficiency.

Cars with fewer cylinders (4-cylinder engines) achieve the best MPG.

Horsepower and efficiency have an inverse relationship: higher horsepower generally means lower MPG.

Over time, average MPG has improved, showing industry progress in fuel efficiency.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mk-1911/Cars-analysis.git


Navigate into the project folder.

Open the notebooks/ folder to view step-by-step analysis.

Open the Power BI file (dashboard/cars_dashboard.pbix) to explore the dashboard.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

Extend analysis to include car prices (if dataset available).

Add predictive modeling using machine learning.

Compare regional differences in fuel efficiency.
